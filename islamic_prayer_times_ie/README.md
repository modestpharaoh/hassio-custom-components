# Hass.io Custom Component - Islamic Prayer Times -IE (Deprecated)

NOTE: This is a deprecated custom component, it is replaced by the wordpress_daily_prayer_time.

This custom component is a forklift of the built-in Home Assistant Islamic Prayer Times component,
but includes prayers times calculated by [Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland: ICCI](https://islamireland.ie/)
along with other calculation methods ignored in the built-in one such as Egypt, France ...etc.

## Install
* Copy the islamic_prayer_times_ie directory into the custom_components directory of home assistant.
* Reboot your Home assistant.
* Go to Integration section in home assistant.
* Press Add Integration, search for "Islamic Prayer Times - IE".
* Dublin, Ireland prayer times are included in:
  * ie-icci >> Islamic Culture Centre - https://islamireland.ie/
    * NOTE: you may find prayers shifted one day older in the year of Feb 29th.
  * ie-mcdn >> Muslim Community of North Dublin - https://www.mcnd.ie/ 
* The component will create 7 time sensors includes the 5 prayer times, sunrise time and midnight time,
* these sensors will be updated to new values at each midnight

## Disclamation
* There is no guarantee that the component will get the correct one, I always try my best to update, whenever there is a bug show up.
